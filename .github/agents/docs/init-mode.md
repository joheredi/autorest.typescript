## Phase 1: Propose the Team

No team exists yet. Propose one — but **DO NOT create any files until the user confirms.**

1. **Identify the user.** Run `git config user.name` to learn who you're working with. Use their name in conversation (e.g., _"Hey Brady, what are you building?"_). Store their name (NOT email) in `team.md` under Project Context. **Never read or store `git config user.email` — email addresses are PII and must not be written to committed files.**
2. Ask: _"What are you building? (language, stack, what it does)"_
3. **Cast the team.** Before proposing names, run the Casting & Persistent Naming algorithm (see that section):
   - Determine team size (typically 4–5 + Scribe).
   - Determine assignment shape from the user's project description.
   - Derive resonance signals from the session and repo context.
   - Select a universe. Allocate character names from that universe.
   - Scribe is always "Scribe" — exempt from casting.
   - Ralph is always "Ralph" — exempt from casting.
4. Propose the team with their cast names. Example (names will vary per cast):

```
🏗️  {CastName1}  — Lead          Scope, decisions, code review
⚛️  {CastName2}  — Frontend Dev  React, UI, components
🔧  {CastName3}  — Backend Dev   APIs, database, services
🧪  {CastName4}  — Tester        Tests, quality, edge cases
📋  Scribe       — (silent)      Memory, decisions, session logs
🔄  Ralph        — (monitor)     Work queue, backlog, keep-alive
```

5. Use the `ask_user` tool to confirm the roster. Provide choices so the user sees a selectable menu:
   - **question:** _"Look right?"_
   - **choices:** `["Yes, hire this team", "Add someone", "Change a role"]`

**⚠️ STOP. Your response ENDS here. Do NOT proceed to Phase 2. Do NOT create any files or directories. Wait for the user's reply.**

## Phase 2: Create the Team

**Trigger:** The user replied to Phase 1 with confirmation ("yes", "looks good", or similar affirmative), OR the user's reply to Phase 1 is a task (treat as implicit "yes").

> If the user said "add someone" or "change a role," go back to Phase 1 step 3 and re-propose. Do NOT enter Phase 2 until the user confirms.

6. Create the `.squad/` directory structure (see `.squad/templates/` for format guides or use the standard structure: team.md, routing.md, ceremonies.md, decisions.md, decisions/inbox/, casting/, agents/, orchestration-log/, skills/, log/).

**Casting state initialization:** Copy `.squad/templates/casting-policy.json` to `.squad/casting/policy.json` (or create from defaults). Create `registry.json` (entries: persistent_name, universe, created_at, legacy_named: false, status: "active") and `history.json` (first assignment snapshot with unique assignment_id).

**Seeding:** Each agent's `history.md` starts with the project description, tech stack, and the user's name so they have day-1 context. Agent folder names are the cast name in lowercase (e.g., `.squad/agents/ripley/`). The Scribe's charter includes maintaining `decisions.md` and cross-agent context sharing.

**Team.md structure:** `team.md` MUST contain a section titled exactly `## Members` (not "## Team Roster" or other variations) containing the roster table. This header is hard-coded in GitHub workflows (`squad-heartbeat.yml`, `squad-issue-assign.yml`, `squad-triage.yml`, `sync-squad-labels.yml`) for label automation. If the header is missing or titled differently, label routing breaks.

**Merge driver for append-only files:** Create or update `.gitattributes` at the repo root to enable conflict-free merging of `.squad/` state across branches:

```
.squad/decisions.md merge=union
.squad/agents/*/history.md merge=union
.squad/log/** merge=union
.squad/orchestration-log/** merge=union
```

The `union` merge driver keeps all lines from both sides, which is correct for append-only files.

7. Say: _"✅ Team hired. Try: '{FirstCastName}, set up the project structure'"_

8. **Post-setup input sources** (optional — ask after team is created, not during casting):
   - PRD/spec: _"Do you have a PRD or spec document? (file path, paste it, or skip)"_ → If provided, follow PRD Mode flow
   - GitHub issues: _"Is there a GitHub repo with issues I should pull from? (owner/repo, or skip)"_ → If provided, follow GitHub Issues Mode flow
   - Human members: _"Are any humans joining the team? (names and roles, or just AI for now)"_ → If provided, add per Human Team Members section
   - Copilot agent: _"Want to include @copilot? It can pick up issues autonomously. (yes/no)"_ → If yes, follow Copilot Coding Agent Member section and ask about auto-assignment
   - These are additive. Don't block — if the user skips or gives a task instead, proceed immediately.
