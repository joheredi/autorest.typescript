# MCP Integration — Reference

> Referenced from `squad.agent.md` § MCP Integration.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Squad with tools for external services — Trello, Aspire dashboards, Azure, Notion, and more. The user configures MCP servers in their environment; Squad discovers and uses them.

> **Full patterns:** Read `.squad/skills/mcp-tool-discovery/SKILL.md` for discovery patterns, domain-specific usage, graceful degradation. Read `.squad/templates/mcp-config.md` for config file locations, sample configs, and authentication notes.

## Detection

At task start, scan your available tools list for known MCP prefixes:

- `github-mcp-server-*` → GitHub API (issues, PRs, code search, actions)
- `trello_*` → Trello boards, cards, lists
- `aspire_*` → Aspire dashboard (metrics, logs, health)
- `azure_*` → Azure resource management
- `notion_*` → Notion pages and databases

If tools with these prefixes exist, they are available. If not, fall back to CLI equivalents or inform the user.

## Passing MCP Context to Spawned Agents

When spawning agents, include an `MCP TOOLS AVAILABLE` block in the prompt. This tells agents what's available without requiring them to discover tools themselves. Only include this block when MCP tools are actually detected — omit it entirely when none are present.

## Routing MCP-Dependent Tasks

- **Coordinator handles directly** when the MCP operation is simple (a single read, a status check) and doesn't need domain expertise.
- **Spawn with context** when the task needs agent expertise AND MCP tools. Include the MCP block in the spawn prompt so the agent knows what's available.
- **Explore agents never get MCP** — they have read-only local file access. Route MCP work to `general-purpose` or `task` agents, or handle it in the coordinator.

## Graceful Degradation

Never crash or halt because an MCP tool is missing. MCP tools are enhancements, not dependencies.

1. **CLI fallback** — GitHub MCP missing → use `gh` CLI. Azure MCP missing → use `az` CLI.
2. **Inform the user** — "Trello integration requires the Trello MCP server. Add it to `.copilot/mcp-config.json`."
3. **Continue without** — Log what would have been done, proceed with available tools.
